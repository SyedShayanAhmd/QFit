# 🤖 Qfit: Automated No-Code Machine Learning Interface

### Overview
**Qfit** is a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to democratize Machine Learning in mechanical engineering labs. It wraps the low-code power of **PyCaret** in a user-friendly **Tkinter** dashboard, allowing researchers to perform complex regression and classification without writing code.

### Capabilities
* **Automated Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, one-hot encoding, and train-test splits automatically.
* **Model Comparison:** Trains and compares 20+ models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) in seconds.
* **Visual Analytics:** Generates residual plots, confusion matrices, and feature importance graphs instantly.

### Technologies
* **Core Logic:** PyCaret (AutoML)
* **Interface:** Tkinter (Python)
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
